  blurbDescription:
    "i’m a little bit weird but that’s just part of my charm!! i like to draw, paint and design with bright colours and fun shapes but I’m also a versatile artist who’s done a little bit of everything. I grew up painting and creating alongside my late father, owen fitzsimmons, who sparked me to become the artist i am today. if i don’t answer the phone you can probably find me eating cucumber and hummus sandwiches in the park. :-)",
